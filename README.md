FirebaseAuthenticationTemplate
==============================

A template Android application for Firebase with a basic authentication screen

It features my preference for authentication, which is to have 1 button for login/signup - tries to signup but if email exists, tries to login

To get it up and running
------------------------

* Need to edit gradle.properties with your own unique firebase url.

TODO:
====
* figure out why new buttons can't be opened
* find out best way to hook up an onItemClickListener to send to DoSkill individual activity
  * (secondary) and if you hold down instead, just a quick preview like Instagram 
* create dialog for blue number input
* remove the red x for now - this seems unnecessary as things get greyed out anyway
