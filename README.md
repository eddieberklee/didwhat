FirebaseAuthenticationTemplate
==============================

A template Android application for Firebase with a basic authentication screen

It features my preference for authentication, which is to have 1 button for login/signup - tries to signup but if email exists, tries to login

To get it up and running
------------------------

* Need to edit gradle.properties with your own unique firebase url.

TODO:
====
* refactor out the blue/red/grey/green properties as a style
